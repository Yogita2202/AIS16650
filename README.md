# AIS16650
Task 1
In this task we learned the rules of variable selection in python.There diifferent rules such as, A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Also  in operators we deals with mathematical operations(+,-,*,/,power,modulues,%).
In List methods we learned the methods like append,clear,copy,count,extend,index,insert,pop,reverse,remove and sort.
Tuple method there are count and index.
In set there are so many methods like difference,diiference update,add,clear,copy,intersection and etc.
In dictionary method we are dealing with pop,copy,clear,remove,fromkeys,get,items,popoitems,setdefault,update and values.
Task 2 a) if statement is a condition statement used to check a condition, and execute it if the condition holds true.
b) If- Else statement he if-else statement is used to execute both the true part and the false part of a given condition.
c) If-elif condition is use to handle multiple conditions to check in short, elif keyword in python saying if the previous conditon were not true then try this condition.
d)A for loop in Python is a control flow statement that is used to repeatedly execute a group of statements as long as the condition is satisfied.
e) A while loop is a control flow statement which allows code to be executed repeatedly, depending on whether a condition is satisfied or not. 
Task 3 a) In Python, the break statement is used to immediately exit a loop when a certain condition is met. When working with nested loops, the break statement can be used to break out of both the inner and outer loops.
b) The continue statement in Python is used to skip the remaining code inside a loop for the current iteration only
c) Pass Statement : The pass statement in Python is used when a statement or a condition is required to be present in the program, but we don't want any command or code to execute.
d) Statistical Functions: In the python the statistic module provides functions to perform statistical operations on data This module offers various functions to calculate measures like mean, median, mode,standard deviation, variance, and more
e)Logical User definde functionca user defined function in python is custom function created by the usder to perform a specific task.
